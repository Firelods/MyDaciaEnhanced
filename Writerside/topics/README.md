# MyDaciaEnhanced

## Introduction
*MyDaciaEnhanced* is a project aimed at enhancing the user experience for Dacia vehicle owners. This repository includes both the front-end and back-end components necessary to deliver a comprehensive solution.

The original application is available on the [Dacia website](https://www.dacia.fr/decouvrez-mydacia.html) 

## Benefits
The main benefits of this project are:
- **Charge Schedule**: The user can schedule the charging of the vehicle's battery, which is useful for taking advantage of off-peak electricity rates.
- **A/C Schedule**: The user can schedule the activation of the vehicle's air conditioning system, which is useful for cooling the vehicle before a trip.

MyDacia only allows users to charge their vehicle's battery or activate the air conditioning system immediately. This project allows users to schedule these actions for a later time.



### Front-End
The front-end is developed using Angular and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the vehicle's features.

### Back-End
The back-end, built with Python, handles data processing, server-side logic, and interactions with the vehicle's systems.
